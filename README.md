# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using supervised machine learning techniques.

The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data preparation, modeling, validation, and interpretation aligned with AI training workflows.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Dataset from Kaggle.
Due to size and licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Model Limitations & Bias

- The dataset is highly imbalanced, which can bias models toward majority class predictions.
- Although Random Forest performs well, it may still miss novel fraud patterns not present in historical data.
- False positives, while reduced, still incur operational review costs.
- Model predictions should be used as decision support rather than fully automated decisions.

These limitations highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and human-in-the-loop validation in AI-driven fraud detection systems.
